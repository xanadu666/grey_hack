// image to dat file tool for xDraw
// by xanadu
// 2024

// make a non-colorized image in notepad in a rectangular x by y box.
//	fill any unused spaces with " "(spacebar).  when you are finished
// 	if you select the whole image with mouse the selected portion should
//  be a rectangle.  if its not you need to adjust the spaces in your image.
	
// when the image is finished save it and then run "image to dat file tool"
// 	with the new created image file and an output_file_name and the width x
// 	of the rectangle image.  if the wrong width is entered the output will be
// 	incorrect data.

// after file has been outputted.  open it with CodeEditor.exe and add color
// 	to the desired fields then save and make able to import

// now you can import the dat file into source code and input into xDraw 
// example: if you named output file "family_photo" then you would use xDraw(family_photo) to draw the image
// remember that the display vertices in xDraw must be set to match the length and width of your image.
